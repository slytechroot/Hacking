CHISEL
- this is a server/service that can run in server or client states
https://github.com/jpillora/chisel

./chisel -h
- the chisel server is not? connected to the internet, but has an open port on 3333. could be useful for airgapped computers?

./chisel server -p 3333

(remote system)(5555 - is the local port on our remote machine)
./chisel32 client 192.168.1.70:3333 5555:192.168.1.1:80

- now the traffic is getting routed through the server connected to the internet. useful when we need to push the traffic through the first machine setup as server with chisel.

sudo tcpdump -i any 192.168.1.70

(back on the remote system)
wget http://127.0.0.1:5555/

- you should get requested in the tcpdump!!!!!
