CHISEL
- this is a server/service that can run in server or client states
https://github.com/jpillora/chisel

./chisel -h
- the chisel server is not? connected to the internet, but has an open port on 3333. could be useful for airgapped computers?

./chisel server -p 3333

(remote system)(5555 - is the local port on our remote machine)
./chisel32 client 192.168.1.70:3333 5555:192.168.1.1:80

- now the traffic is getting routed through the server connected to the internet. useful when we need to push the traffic through the first machine setup as server with chisel.

sudo tcpdump -i any 192.168.1.70

(back on the remote system)
wget http://127.0.0.1:5555/

- you should get requested in the tcpdump!!!!!

#####################
USING CHISEL with REVERSE
- 'reverse' is used when a chisel client is tunneling its traffic through the chisel server, it can open on the server any 'reverse' port for return traffic it wants. The port has been closed since the client opened it.

./chisel server -p 3333 --reverse

./chisel32 client 192.168.1.70:3333 R:4444:192.168.1.69:80
(should be connected)
(you should see the session getting established on the 'chisel server')

Browse the website located on the remote .69 system from the system where you started the chisel server.
http://127.0.0.1:4444

######################
USING CHISEL with REVERSE and SOCKS5
(Kali)
./chisel server -p 3333 --reverse --socks5

(another Linux system)
./chisel32 client 192.168.1.70:3333 R:5555:socks

(back on Kali)
sudo nano /etc/proxychains4.conf

add:
socks5 127.0.0.1 5555

(back on Kali. perform a port scan)
proxychains nmap -p80,21 192.168.1.69
