IP over ICMP
https://github.com/friedrich/hans

(server)
sudo ./hans -s 10.1.1.1 -f -v -p test123

(client)
sudo ./hans -c 192.168.69.133 -f -v -p test123
(connection should establish)

ping an IP address between the client and server to test connectivity.

enable IP forwarding for both the server and client:
sudo nano /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
0 -> 1

sudo route add -net 10.10.10.0/24 gw 10.1.1.100

route
(should see the gateway IP)

sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.1.1.1 -o ens38 -J MASQUERADE
(is the gateway wrong?)

This example did NOT work!!!!
Try to replicate.
