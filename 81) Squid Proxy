sudo apt install squid

sudo nano /etc/squid/squid.conf
or
sudo leafpad /etc/squid/squid.conf
(search for 'http_access' and change to 'allow all' instead of 'deny all' under 'And finally deny all other access to this proxy')

sudo systemctl restart squid

sudo apt install htop

sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy.conf

- if the proxy.conf does not exist, a file needs to be created at that path.

proxy.conf:
Acquire::http::Proxy "http://kali:6969";
Acquire::https::Proxy "https://kali:6969";
(close)

sudo apt install htop
